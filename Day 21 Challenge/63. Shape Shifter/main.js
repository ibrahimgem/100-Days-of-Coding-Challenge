// Question 63: Shape Shifter: Write a program that can describe either a circle or a rectangle using a special type alias, including properties unique to each shape.
// Explain & TIP: A type alias lets you create a custom type. It's like a shortcut for describing more complex information, such as the details of different shapes.
let circle = {
    radius: 10
};
let rectangle = {
    width: 3,
    length: 10
};
console.log(circle, rectangle);
