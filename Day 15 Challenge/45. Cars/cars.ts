//Question 45: Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

let cars = (manufacturer: string, model: string, color: string, fuel: string) => {
  let car = {
    manufacturer: manufacturer,
    model: model,
    color: color,
    fuel: fuel
  };
  console.log(car);
};

cars('Toyota', 'Corolla', 'Red', 'Gasoline');
cars('Audi', 'e-tron', 'Black', 'Electric');
cars('Ford', 'Mustang', 'Red', 'Gasoline');
